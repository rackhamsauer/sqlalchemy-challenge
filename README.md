Hawaii Data Analysis with Flask
This repository contains the work I completed for the Hawaii Data Analysis project, where the goal was to connect a database, retrieve and visualize data, and present it through a simple Flask web application. This project served as a deep dive into Flask, data visualization, and database management.

Overview
In this project, I connected to a database containing Hawaii weather data, retrieved the necessary information, and built a Flask web application to display the data. The goal was to create visualizations based on the data and make the results accessible via a simple web interface.

Key Steps
Connecting to the Database:
I connected to the Hawaii weather data database and confirmed that all tables could be accessed correctly. This was an important first step in ensuring that the data retrieval process was working as expected.

Data Retrieval:
The next step involved figuring out the best way to pull the data from the database. I spent a significant amount of time trying to determine the most efficient approach for querying the database and extracting relevant weather data.

Flask Web Application:
This project was my first real dive into Flask, and I enjoyed how quickly I could set up a basic web application to display the data. I was able to use the Flask framework to build a simple interface for interacting with the weather data and visualizations.

Visualization:
I used various techniques to improve the appearance of the visualizations:

For the histogram, I added an 'edge' to the bars to make the graph visually clearer.
For the larger graphs, I set a forced range to ensure the data was presented in a consistent and meaningful way.
Tools and Resources Used
Flask for building the web application.
Python for scripting and data manipulation.
Matplotlib for creating the visualizations.
SQLAlchemy for managing database connections and queries.
ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, Tutors, and Classmates for troubleshooting and problem-solving throughout the process.
Challenges Faced
Data Retrieval:
The most time-consuming part of this project was figuring out the best way to retrieve the data from the database. It took a bit of trial and error to get the queries right and ensure that the data was returned in a usable format.

Flask Web Development:
This was my first major project using Flask, so there was a learning curve involved in getting everything set up correctly and ensuring that the data was displayed on the web page as intended.

Data Visualization:
While I enjoyed the process of creating visualizations, it took some effort to ensure they were both accurate and visually appealing. I spent extra time adjusting the histogram edges and setting forced ranges for the larger graphs.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set up your Hawaii weather data database and configure the connection in the Flask app.
Run the Flask app with python app.py and navigate to the provided URL to view the website and visualizations.
Conclusion
This project was a valuable learning experience, especially in diving into Flask and data visualization. While there were challenges along the way, I gained hands-on experience with building a web application, querying databases, and presenting data through graphs. Moving forward, I would continue refining the data retrieval and web interface, especially focusing on improving the user experience and the appearance of visualizations.
